This project depends on AndroidCommon (https://github.com/asksven/AndroidCommon).

Make sure to:
- add AndroidCommon as a Project to Eclipse
- define that project as a lib (Properties -> Android and "Is Library" checked)
- define AndroidCommon as a library referenced by BetterBatteryStats (Properties -> Android and "AndroidCommon" added as a references Lib

Note: One some Eclipse there is a bug preventing the referenced library to stick between Eclipse restarts.
Only known workaround (to me): Go to Properties -> Android of BetteryBatteryStats and remove the referenced Lib, close, go to Properties -> Android again and re-add (close between those actions is mandatory for this to work)
